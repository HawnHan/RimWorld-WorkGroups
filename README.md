# WorkGroups
### *"You're the doctor, until you die, or I find someone better.."*

I wanted this mod so I could focus on more "adding skilled pawns" and less "shuffling work priorities" when I find some, or when some of mine die.

## Features
 * Create and prioritize WorkGroups (groupings of Work categories with a Name) that are assigned together to pawns with the highest skills.
 * Designate which WorkGroups are allowed to be set on the same Pawn to prevent your Researcher also being designated as your Planter (WorkGroups that are selected for a pawn come with a `+1` priority, so in this case this pawn would be a *backup* planter, for if he had no research tasks lined up.)
 * (Optionally) Set Title for pawns who are designated to match their selected WorkGroups (works great with Guards For Me to see at a glance what each pawn's roles are)
 * (Optionally) Automatically clear any new pawns schedules to 24 hours of `Anything`.
 * (Optionally) Set a WorkGroup to be applied to every pawn (I use this for my `Self-Preservation` group as highest-priority, and also for my `Basics` group at lowest priority)
 * (Optionally) Enable/Disable a WorkGroup to be set for Colonists 
 * (Optionally) Enable/Disable a WorkGroup to be set for Slaves (Simple Slavery support),
 * (Optionally) Enable/Disable a WorkGroup to be set for Prisoners (Prison Labor support),
 * (Optionally) Force bed rest on injured pawns, allowing them to heal while other pawns pick up their slack (if they're not dead..)
 * Save and Load all the settings at your whim! Super convenient for starting new colonies for us habitual restarters..
 * (Optionally) Use Learning Rate to be a factor in who gets assigned to which WorkGroups!
 * (Optionally) Select Important Stats for a given WorkGroup - utilize your bionic pawns capabilities to their fullest potential!

## Notes
 * Save friendly! If adding to an existing save, note that it starts out disabled. You'll need to enable it via the new WorkGroups button on the tab bar at the bottom of your screen.
 * Supports modded work types. These get discovered at runtime, so if it's on that tab, it'll be in here.
 * If removing a mod that adds work types, the next load will log some Warnings as it cleans up references to those work types from your WorkGroups. These are harmless, and will only appear once.
